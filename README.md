## MaSGAN Model
- •	The MaSGAN model adopts an encoder-decoder-encoder structure. The primary encoder learns the distribution of normal samples, while the secondary encoder reduces the dimension of generated samples for anomaly detection.
>Developed in Java based on the Android Studio platform, Windows 10.

### System operating environment：
>The simulation program runs on Android emulators. For optimal performance, the Android version should be Android 6.0 or higher.

### System operation instructions：

#### Running the Simulation Program on a PC:
>Setting up the Emulator:
>* In Android Studio on your PC, set up a suitable Android emulator (virtual device) that meets the required specifications (Android 6.0 or higher). This emulator will serve as the environment for running the simulation program.

>Running in the Emulator:
>* Install the simulation app on the emulator.
>* Launch the app within the emulator by clicking its icon.

>Executing Simulation of Different Approaches:
>* Click the relevant buttons within the app interface to execute corresponding approaches.
>* The app will display simulation parameters and results on the emulator screen, allowing you to observe the performance of different collaborative recovery process.

>Observing Simulation Results:
>* The simulation app will showcase relevant metrics such as frame rate, bit rate and decoding rate directly within the app interface.
